### EDA - 2020 Kaggle Machine Learning Data Science Survey - India-USA comparisons  
<span style="color:darkblue">_Exploratory Data Analysis_</span><br>
Since 2017, Kaggle has been conducting annual industry-wide surveys to get an overview of the state of data science and machine learning worldwide. The collected (and cleansed) data then becomes the base for a competition for the Kaggle community to explore and glean data stories out of, whether about a section or about an aspect of the data science community. 2020 marks the third year since the initiation of the Annual Data Science Survey Challenge.

The largest participants in the survey sample were from India (29%) and USA (11%). So, this project was initiated with the intent to study the contrasts between the overall scenario and the India and US trends.
